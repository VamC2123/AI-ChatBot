 # HACKATHON DETAILS and PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project was developed as part of the SMART INDIA HACKATHON (SIH)-2024. The hackathon challenged participants to create innovative solutions to address real-world problems. Our team selected the theme of healthcare and well-being, focusing on the problem of making natural medicinal knowledge more accessible. The problem statement was to design a platform that educates users about the medicinal properties of various herbs, promoting traditional healing practices while leveraging modern technology.


# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Virtual Herbal Garden project is a comprehensive platform that provides users with detailed information about medicinal plants, their uses, and their preparation methods. At the heart of the platform is a dynamic AI-powered chatbot that allows users to interact seamlessly and gather information in an engaging, multilingual manner.
The chatbot integrates a user-friendly front-end with a robust backend powered by the Gemini API (Google Generative AI) and Flask, ensuring accurate and informative responses. This project is designed to bridge the gap between traditional knowledge and modern accessibility, making it an essential tool for natural health enthusiasts.
